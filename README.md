## Project Description

This project utilizes HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap 5.3 to create a web form for Business Analytics students. 
The HTML creates the basic structure and content of the web page, while CSS and Boostrap were used to style the content. 

## Best Practices

This web form conforms to best practices for forms in numerous ways. 

First, the correct input type is used for each question within the form so that the data collected remains clean and easily analyzable. For example, questions that are likely to have various different answers across all respondents have a text box that allows users to type their own answer. Meanwhile, the responses that are likely to fall into specific categories use a dropdown menu such as the state question. Additionally, asking students their impression of the major uses a likert scale, which results in data that can be measured on the same scale. 

Some other details of the form cerfify best practices as well. The page numbers at the bottom of the form tell users where they are within the form. The beginning page introduces the form and sets expectations, while the last page satisfies the user by letting them know the survey is done and their answer has been saved. The form is also dynamic, meaning it's usable on all devices. 

Additionally, this form is WCAG compliant, as described below. 

## Accessibility
This web form adheres to WCAG 2.1 level AA standards, which ensures the form is accessible to anyone who may be interested in taking it. To achieve this, I used high-contrast colors (like blue, white, and black), alt text on images for those who use screen readers, and the same language throughout the form.
